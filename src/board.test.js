// it seems to point to the same array, this is the next problem to solve

// next tests:
// need functionality to handle placing "sting values" instead of hardcoding them re length -- loop? - done!!
// place all 5 ships
// ships can't overlap
// place ships vertically
// Should this logic be inside the Ship class? I should probably put this in a function/method - done!

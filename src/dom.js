// const Player = require("./player");

// Next Steps
// Recursion?? - if computer hits a previous Miss or achieves a Hit, it goes again? - Done!
// The player gets another turn it if achieves a Hit - Done!
// Player squares need to be deactivated until computer places hit - Done!
// Allow Player to input name (need to replace all stephens here) - Done!
// Stop Comp ships from intersecting - Done!
// Allow Player to place ships
// Apply ship images to the board
// Need to show once all of a ship as sunk, once whole length hit in Dom
// Add sound effects and maybe one second delay before player can click again (if they achieve a hit)
// Improve the computer AI
// Separate DOM from player class - figure out what the issue is with importing

// module.exports = { renderMyBoard, renderComputerBoard };
